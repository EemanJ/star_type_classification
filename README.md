# Star Type Classification
Principal component analysis and Classification analysis on a dataset about star types.

The project focuses on star-type classification from a Kaggle dataset, based on different star attributes, mentioned in the Jupyter Notebook.

There is a report attached that explains the findings. It focuses on statistical analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Machine learning Classification algorithms to predict the final output using data gathered from multiple variables, i.e. attributes.
